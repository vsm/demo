More info:

• This demo also enables you to paste VSM-JSON data and see the corresponding VSM-sentence.

• You can export this VSM-sentence to for example an SVG image:
  a sharp, lightweight vector format.

• If you set a `delay ..` for like 3 seconds, and then click the `Download SVG` button,
  then you still have some time to go mouse-hover any connector you may want to see highlighted
  in the image, before the Save dialog appears.

• Checking the `✓ White box` option will remove the vsm-box border and background,
  ◦ The `✓ auto-white` option checks that option by default once you click Download,
    resulting in an image that shows the VSM-sentence only.
  ◦ Disable both `auto-white` and `White box` to create an image that includes vsm-box border
    and background, i.e. an image that shows how a VSM-sentence appears in a curation interface.

• For info on how to convert SVG to EMG properly (e.g. for Word or Google Docs),
  click the `EMF tips` link.


• If you give a live demo or presentation of VSM, you can let the audience focus on the vsm-box
  alone by moving the top information panel (and/or bottom JSON textarea) out of sight.
  You can do this with the vertical-space resize-handles, located to the right, just above the
  JSON textarea's right border.
