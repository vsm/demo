More info:

== JSON ==
• This demo also enables you to paste VSM-JSON in the large textfield,
  and see the corresponding VSM-sentence in the vsm-box above it.


== SVG ==
• You can export a VSM-sentence to for example an SVG image:
  a sharp, lightweight vector format.

• If you set a `delay ..` for like 3 seconds, and then click the `Download SVG` button,
  then you still have some time to go mouse-hover any connector you may want to see highlighted
  in the image, before the Save dialog appears.

• Checking the `✓ White box` option will remove the vsm-box border and background,
  ◦ The `✓ auto-white` option checks that option by default once you click Download,
    resulting in an image that shows the VSM-sentence only.
  ◦ Disable both `auto-white` and `White box` to create an image that includes vsm-box border
    and background, i.e. an image that shows how a VSM-sentence appears in a curation interface.

• For info on how to convert SVG to EMG properly (e.g. for Word or Google Docs),
  click the `EMF tips` link.


== SVG, bonus ==
• The SVG includes some hidden elements that you can show when needed, using SVG-editor software.
  These elements are just white or have 0% opacity.
  - A text cursor:  in the first empty VSM-term.
  - A mouse cursor and click-indicating stripes:  over the last leg of a connector highlighter.
  - The background square of a connector-remove-icon (as seen when mouse-hovered in a vsm-box).
  ► To make these visible, e.g. in Illustrator do:
    Window --> Appearance --> open each of Stroke|Fill's sublist --> Opacity --> Opacity: 100%.
• To make the input-field at the end of a vsm-box visible in the SVG: put some text in it; and
  use a space if it should be shown as empty.
• If you generate an SVG that includes a vsm-box border, and the vsm-box has grown too wide:
  hit Ctrl+Del in the input-field behind the last term so that it will narrow.


== For demos ==
• If you give a live demo or presentation, you can make the audience focus on just the vsm-box
  by moving the top information panel (and/or bottom JSON textarea) out of sight: use the
  whitespace-resizing handles, just above and below the right side of the JSON textfield.
